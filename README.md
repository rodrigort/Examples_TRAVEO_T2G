# üöÄ Traveo T2G Examples

This repository contains a collection of hands-on examples for the **Infineon Traveo II (T2G)** microcontroller family, developed using **Visual Studio Code** and **ModusToolbox**.

Each project is designed to demonstrate the configuration and usage of various peripheral drivers using the **Peripheral Driver Library (PDL)**, helping developers quickly get started with embedded systems based on Traveo T2G.

## üîß Tools Used

- [ModusToolbox](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/design-support/tools/sdk/modustoolbox-software/)
- Visual Studio Code (with optional Infineon extensions)
- Device Configurator
- Peripheral Driver Library (PDL)
- KIT_T2G-B-E_Lite (primary test board)
