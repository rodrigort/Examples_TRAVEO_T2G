## üõ†Ô∏è Description

- LED 3 on the board is connected to pin **P5_0**
- The LED is toggled every 1 second using a delay created with `Cy_SysLib_Delay()`
- The project is based on the PDL (Peripheral Driver Library)
- Pin configuration is handled via **Device Configurator**
- **The entire project was developed using Visual Studio Code** with ModusToolbox toolchain integration

## üì¶ Requirements

- Infineon KIT_T2G-B-E_Lite
- ModusToolbox (tested with version 3.x)
- Visual Studio Code configured for C development (with optional Infineon extensions)
- USB debugger connected to the board
